## Tier 1 — Fix Now

Crashes, active CVEs, broken functionality, exploitable security issues.

| ID   | Component | Item                                         | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| DEP1 | build     | Go 1.26.1 has 4 active CVEs                 | x509 auth bypass, x509 chain work, x509 policy validation, TLS 1.3 KeyUpdate DoS. All reached via gateway/filesync/clipsync code paths. Fixed in Go 1.26.2. |
| ~~E1~~ | ~~core~~ | ~~No `recover()` on server-side goroutines~~ | Done. Added `recover()` to `handleDirectTCPIP`, `handleSession`, `handleTCPIPForward`, `handleCancelTCPIPForward`, `handleSocks5`, `handleHTTPProxy`. |
| ~~E3~~ | ~~clipsync~~ | ~~`postHTTP` nil panic from malformed peer~~ | Done. Error from `http.NewRequestWithContext` now checked; malformed peer logged and skipped. |
| ~~C1~~ | ~~sshd~~ | ~~`keepalive@openssh.com` rejected~~       | Done. Added `case "keepalive@openssh.com"` → reply `true` in server global request handler. |
| ~~S2~~ | ~~clipsync~~ | ~~Unauthenticated HTTP endpoints~~       | Done. `canReceiveFrom` now validates against loopback, static peers, and UDP-discovered peers. |
| ~~S3~~ | ~~core~~ | ~~Gzip decompression bomb~~                | Done. `gzipDecode` in clipsync capped at `2 × maxClipboardPayload` (200 MB), filesync at `4 × maxIndexPayload` (40 MB). |
| ~~E2~~ | ~~gateway~~ | ~~`json.Marshal` error → nil body 200 OK~~ | Done. Marshal errors return 500 with error message in both `handleA2O` and `handleO2A`. |
| ~~W1~~ | ~~sshd~~ | ~~`password_command` hardcodes `sh -c`~~   | Done. Build-tagged `exec_unix.go` / `exec_windows.go` with `shellCommand()` helper. Windows prefers `pwsh.exe`, falls back to `cmd.exe`. |
| ~~W2~~ | ~~filesync~~ | ~~`filepath.Match` breaks on Windows~~ | Done. Replaced all `filepath.Match` with `path.Match` in `ignore.go`. |
| ~~W3~~ | ~~filesync~~ | ~~`os.Rename` over existing files fails on Windows~~ | Done. Added `renameReplace()` helper — tries rename, falls back to remove+rename. Used in `index.go` and `transfer.go`. |
| ~~S12~~ | ~~windows~~ | ~~`SO_REUSEADDR` allows port hijacking~~ | Done. Replaced with `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` in `listen_windows.go`. |

## Tier 2 — Fix Soon

Security hardening, correctness, data integrity, protocol compliance.

| ID   | Component | Item                                         | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| S1   | clipsync  | No TLS for clipsync HTTP                     | HTTPS only, auto-TLS with self-signed certs if none provided. Zero-config. |
| FS4  | filesync  | No TLS / auth for filesync HTTP              | Same auto-TLS approach as S1 — share the implementation. |
| S4   | admin     | Admin server allows non-loopback bind        | `admin_addr` not validated as loopback. `0.0.0.0:7777` exposes state, logs, pprof. Reject non-loopback at config validation. |
| S5   | sshd      | No per-connection channel limit              | Authenticated client can open unlimited channels → goroutine exhaustion. Add `atomic.Int64` counter, reject above 1000. |
| C2   | sshd      | Default SSH user hardcoded to `root`         | OpenSSH defaults to OS username. Causes unexpected root login attempts. `tunnel.go:536`. |
| Q1   | core      | `gzipEncode`/`gzipDecode` duplicated        | Identical in clipsync and filesync. Extract to shared package. Prerequisite for consistent S3 fix. |
| U1   | config    | `Forward.Type` default not applied           | Struct comment says "Defaults to forward" but validation rejects empty type. Most common config error for new users. |
| P4   | filesync  | `io.ReadAll` up to 4 GB for delta response   | `transfer.go` reads entire delta response into memory. Cap at 256 MB or stream directly. |
| S9   | gateway   | Upstream error body logged verbatim (64 MB)  | May contain API key fragments. Goes to log file and ring buffer. Truncate to 512 bytes. |
| S6   | filesync  | `isLoopback` misses IPv4-mapped IPv6         | String comparison misses `::ffff:127.0.0.1`. Use `net.ParseIP(ip).IsLoopback()`. |
| S7   | sshd      | `GatewayPorts=clientspecified` allows `0.0.0.0` | Reject wildcard bind addresses for remote forwards unless explicitly allowed. |
| E4   | sshd      | `ServerAliveInterval` Atoi error swallowed   | `"30s"` silently sets interval to 0, disabling keepalives. `tunnel.go:1572`. |
| E5   | sshd      | `loadSigner`/`loadAuthorizedKeys` bare errors | "ssh: no key found" with no file path context. Wrap with filename. `tunnel.go:1437-1448`. |
| DOC1 | schema    | JSON Schema missing `accept_env`, `banner`, `motd` | `additionalProperties: false` rejects valid configs in IDEs. |
| W6   | sshd      | `sessionEnv` panics on UNC home directories  | `home[:2]` assumes drive letter. Use `filepath.VolumeName()`. `shell_windows.go:39-40`. |
| C3   | gateway   | `thinking` blocks silently dropped           | Extended thinking content dropped in both translation directions. Increasingly used feature. |
| C4   | gateway   | `response_format` silently dropped           | `json_object` mode parsed but dropped. Clients expecting guaranteed JSON get unstructured text. |

## Tier 3 — Improve

Performance, UX, reliability, code quality, documentation, DevOps.

### Robustness & Error Handling

| ID   | Component | Item                                         | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| E6   | filesync  | `rateLimitedReader` discards `WaitN` error   | Burst < buffer size silently bypasses rate limiting. `ratelimit.go:30`. |
| E7   | config    | Validation errors lack node name context     | Multi-node configs produce ambiguous errors. `config.go:533,538`. |
| E8   | state     | `SnapshotFull` atomicity claim is false      | `sync.Map.Range` independent of `mu.RLock`. Fix comment or move metrics into mutex. |
| S8   | sshd      | `PermitOpen` bypass via alternate hostnames  | String comparison on unresolved `DestAddr`. Document limitation or restrict to IP-only. |
| S10  | config    | Writable config enables `password_command` injection | `warnInsecurePermissions` only warns. Consider hard reject. |
| S11  | clipsync  | UDP beacon port used for SSRF               | `msg.GetPort()` from unauthenticated beacon. Mitigated by fixing S2. |
| D4   | ops       | Stale PID file detection                    | `upCmd` overwrites stale PID files from crashes. Check if running first. |

### Performance

| ID   | Component | Item                                         | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| ~~P1~~ | ~~core~~ | ~~Profile and optimize CPU + memory~~      | Done. Commits `363f775`, `a27bbfa`, `3bb6b4d`. |
| P5   | core      | Pool `gzip.Writer`/`gzip.Reader`            | ~300 KB internal state allocated per request. `sync.Pool` with `Reset()`. |
| P6   | clipsync  | `proto.Marshal` re-serialization for size   | Pass original body size from HTTP handler instead. |
| P7   | filesync  | Maintain active file count                  | Four O(n) loops → maintain `activeCount` field. |
| P8   | filesync  | Merge temp cleanup into scan walk           | Eliminate redundant full tree traversal. |
| P9   | filesync  | `hashFile` uses `fmt.Sprintf("%x")`         | Replace with `hex.EncodeToString`. |
| P10  | filesync  | `hashEqual` manual loop                     | Replace with `bytes.Equal` (compiler intrinsic). |
| P11  | sshd      | Parse `PermitOpen` once at startup          | Pre-parse into `map[string]bool`. |
| P12  | config    | Normalize `GetOption` keys at load          | Lowercase once, map lookup O(1). |
| P13  | cli       | Use `SnapshotFull()` in dashboard           | Two separate locks → one atomic call. |
| P3   | filesync  | Adaptive watch/scan                         | Self-tuning heuristic. See [design](#adaptive-watchscan-design) below. |

### UX & CLI

| ID   | Component | Item                                         | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| U2   | cli       | `mesh down` requires valid config file      | `down` only needs pidfiles. Scan `~/.mesh/run/mesh-*.pid` when no args given. |
| U3   | cli       | `mesh status -w` shows no metrics           | Always passes `nil` for `metricsMap`. Fetch from admin API. |
| U6   | cli       | `mesh help` omits filesync, gateway, admin  | Major feature discoverability gap. |
| U7   | cli       | Config not found gives raw OS error         | No guidance on search paths or examples. Poor first-run experience. |
| U5   | cli       | `mesh status` exit code 3 undocumented      | Document exit codes in help text. |
| U10  | cli       | `mesh down` exits 0 if nothing stopped      | Track whether any node was stopped. |
| U4   | cli       | Config errors lack YAML line numbers        | Array indices require manual counting in large files. |
| U8   | cli       | Dashboard log tail hard-coded to 10 lines   | Compute dynamically from viewport height. |
| U9   | admin     | Web UI fetches all 6 APIs every second      | Gate fetches by active tab. |
| P2   | cli       | Simplify CLI dashboard                      | See [design](#cli-dashboard-simplification) below. |

### Cross-Platform

| ID   | Component | Item                                         | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| W4   | config    | `warnInsecurePermissions` false positives on Windows | `Mode().Perm()` returns synthetic `0666`. Skip on Windows. |
| W5   | config    | `expandHome` only handles `~/`, not `~\`    | Windows users write `~\`. Also check `~` + `os.PathSeparator`. |
| W7   | clipsync  | `runtime.GOOS` instead of build tags        | 6 switch blocks. CLAUDE.md convention violated. Refactor to build-tagged files. |
| W8   | cli       | `checkPid`/`killPid` use `runtime.GOOS`    | Same violation. Move to build-tagged files. |

### Protocol Compatibility

| ID   | Component | Item                                         | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| C5   | gateway   | Static `msg_stream` as message ID           | Should generate unique IDs. Breaks dedup/logging. |
| C6   | sshd      | Server keepalive uses non-standard type     | `keepalive@golang.org` — non-Go clients may not reply. |
| C7   | sshd      | Public-key auth only on server side         | No password/keyboard-interactive server auth. Asymmetry may surprise users. |
| C8   | gateway   | `n > 1` silently returns 1 choice           | No error returned to client. |
| C9   | gateway   | Temperature silently clamped                | > 1.0 clamped to 1.0 without indication. |

### Code Quality

| ID   | Component | Item                                         | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|-------|
| Q2   | sshd      | Metrics reset duplicated 4 times            | Add `Metrics.Reset()` method. |
| Q3   | sshd      | `runForwardSet` duplication                 | ~60 lines retry/handshake boilerplate. Extract `runConnectLoop`. |
| Q4   | gateway   | `handleA2O`/`handleO2A` duplication         | Extract shared `doUpstreamRequest`. |
| Q5   | sshd      | Magic timing constants scattered            | Add `defaultTCPKeepAlive`, `defaultRetryInterval`. |
| Q6   | core      | `activeNodes` registry duplicated           | Identical pattern in filesync and clipsync. Extract generic registry. |
| Q7   | sshd      | `"keepalive"` sentinel not a constant       | Invisible coupling. Use named constant. |
| Q8   | gateway   | `mustMarshal` silently discards errors      | Remove wrapper, use explicit error handling. |

### Documentation

| ID    | Component | Item                                         | Notes |

## Tier 4 — Features

| ID   | Component | Item                                | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| N3   | clipsync  | File/image copy support             | Copy a file or directory on one computer, paste on another. Image clipboard content also in scope. Small files: transfer immediately via existing push mechanism. Large files: needs lazy-copy design (transfer only when user pastes). Two-phase approach: ship eager copy for small files first, design lazy copy separately. |
| N4   | admin     | Action history in web UI            | Clipboard activity, file sync activity, past metrics. Partially started. |
| N6   | admin     | Tree-table layout for web dashboard | Collapsible nodes for component hierarchy. |
| F2   | cli       | `mesh init` command                 | Interactive config generator. Scaffolds starter YAML. |
| F5   | sshd      | SFTP subsystem                      | `subsystem` request handling. Requires `github.com/pkg/sftp`. Enables scp/sftp/rsync over mesh. |
| F6   | sshd      | SSH agent forwarding                | `auth-agent-req@openssh.com`. Temp Unix socket, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`. Unix-only. |

|------|-----------|------------------------------|-------|
| F3   | cli       | SSH client subcommands       | Ad-hoc `mesh ssh user@host`. Needs terminal raw mode, SIGWINCH. |
| F4   | sshd      | User switching               | `setuid`/`setgid` (Unix), `CreateProcessAsUser` (Windows). Root required. |
| F1   | core      | Config hot-reload            | File watcher, config diff, per-component context cancellation. |
| F11  | sshd      | X11 forwarding               | Xauth, Unix socket, channel multiplex. Low demand. |
| R5   | docs      | README: demo GIF             | |
| R6   | release   | Homebrew formula             | |

| ~~W2~~ | Cross-platform ignore matching    | `filepath.Match` → `path.Match` for forward-slash consistency. |
| ~~W3~~ | Cross-platform atomic rename      | `renameReplace()` helper: remove-then-rename fallback for Windows. |
| ~~S12~~ | Windows port hijacking defense   | `SO_REUSEADDR` → `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` on Windows. |

## Design: CLI Dashboard Simplification

| Section | Action | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Header (node/version/pid/uptime/total metrics) | KEEP | Essential at-a-glance identification. |
| Config/log/UI paths | KEEP | Quick reference. |
| Clipsync (listeners + peer status) | KEEP | Lightweight, high diagnostic value. |
| Filesync peers | SIMPLIFY | One line per folder with status + file count + last sync. Per-peer detail → web UI. |
| Listeners + active reverse tunnels | KEEP | Core network topology. |
| Connections (targets + forwards) | KEEP | Essential "what's connected to where" view. |
| Unmapped dynamic ports | REMOVE | Debug-only noise → web UI diagnostics. |
| Per-row metrics | SIMPLIFY | tx/rx only on "producer" rows (listeners, active forwards). |
| Log tail | KEEP | Limit to last ~20 lines. Full log in web UI. |

---

## Design: Adaptive Watch/Scan

Goal: dynamically watch frequently-changing paths with fsnotify, poll the rest. No new config properties. Self-tuning.

**Change frequency tracking:** `map[string]*FrequencyEntry` with `{changeCount, windowStart, lastDemotedAt}`. Increment on fsnotify event or scan-detected change. Reset windows older than 5 minutes. "Hot" = >5 changes per 5-minute window.

**Promotion:** After each scan, if a directory is hot and unwatched, and total watch count < soft limit (3000), add to fsnotify.

**Demotion:** 0 changes across 2 consecutive windows (~10 min) → remove watch. 10-min cooldown before re-promoting.

**Edge cases:**
- *Burst in new directory:* Detected on next scan, promoted then.
- *Directory deletion:* fsnotify Remove event; stale cleanup (5-min interval) as safety net.
- *Large initial scan:* No promotions on first scan. Second scan begins adaptive behavior.
- *Watch limit pressure:* Sort by frequency, promote top N that fit.

## Other Notes

- Auto load .env file from the current directory to load environment variables securely.
